        <h2>How Earth Was Born</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>A long time ago there was a <b>Big Bang.</b>It was a loud noise that Big Bang created Earth,Earth was unstable that time,it was full of gasses and lava,it was in no condition to live in.The universe was filled with neutrons,protons.electrols,anti-electrons,photons,and neutrinos.Many people say thats the story others say God created Earth.Life on Earth was discovered 3.5 billion years ago,believe it or not the first animal on Earth was a <b>Comb Jelly the second were the jellyfish.</b>The Dinosours were a big history of Earth they first appeared approximately 230 million years ago and were extinct about 65 years ago,they were killed by a <b>astroid impact.</b></p>
        <p>After Dinosours died somehow <b>mammals survived,thrived,and became dominat across the planet.</b>Then humans evolved from apelike ancestors and in the biginning humans came from Africa the first human was <b>Homo habilis</b>, <b>humans evolved in Africa about 315,000 years ago</b>b.Life started when things cooled down,simple organic molecules began to form under the blanket of hyrogen.The colour of the first humans were dark skin.</p>

        <h2>My Favourite Planet and Galaxy</h2>
        <p>My favourite planet is Venus because Venus a day in Venus is longer than a year and Venus is hotter than Mercury despite being further away from the sun also Venus unlike other planets in our solar system Venus spins clockwise on its axis,venus has many fact that why I like it so much.My favourite galaxy is the NGC 6946 one of the ressons why is that it is very beautiful and it takes 22.5 million light years to get there. </p>
